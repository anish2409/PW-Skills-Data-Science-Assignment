    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "A Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mean prediction of the individual trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting."

    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
