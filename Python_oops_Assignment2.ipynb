    "    Consider the concept of a \"Vehicle.\" When you think of a vehicle, you immediately have a general understanding of what it is and what it can do (e.g., move, transport people or goods). However, the term \"vehicle\" is an abstract concept itself. In programming, you might create an abstract class or interface named Vehicle that defines common attributes and methods for all types of vehicles, like startEngine(), stopEngine(), and move(). Each specific type of vehicle (car, motorcycle, truck) would then inherit from this abstract class or interface and provide its own implementation of the methods, adding the necessary details specific to that type."
