    "API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to request and exchange information or services between systems. APIs are essential for enabling the integration of different software components and systems.\n",

    "Example: In real life, when you use a weather app on your smartphone to check the weather forecast for your location, it connects to a weather service's API to fetch and display the weather data. The app doesn't store the weather information itself but instead relies on the API to provide the data."
