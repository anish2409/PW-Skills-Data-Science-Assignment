    "# Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to specific functions or views within your web application. It allows you to define different URL patterns and associate them with the corresponding Python functions that handle the requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how app routing works in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define Routes: In your Flask application, you can define routes using the `@app.route()` decorator. This decorator specifies the URL pattern that should trigger the associated function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, world!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `'/'` URL pattern corresponds to the `index()` function, which will be executed when a user visits the root URL of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handle Requests: When a user visits a specific URL within your Flask application, Flask's underlying web server receives the request and matches it to the appropriate route based on the URL pattern. It then calls the associated function to handle the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate Responses: The function associated with a route performs any necessary logic, such as retrieving data from a database or processing form inputs. It then returns a response, which can be an HTML page, JSON data, or any other content that you want to send back to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "App routes are used in Flask for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. URL Mapping: App routes allow you to define the structure and organization of your web application's URLs. You can specify different routes for different pages or functionalities within your application. This helps in creating clean and logical URL structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Request Handling: App routes define the functions that handle incoming requests for specific URLs. They provide a way to separate different parts of your application's functionality into individual views or endpoints. This allows for better organization and maintainability of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RESTful APIs: If you're building a web API with Flask, app routes play a crucial role in defining the API endpoints and mapping them to the appropriate functions that handle the requests. This enables clients to interact with your API by sending requests to specific URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dynamic Behavior: App routes can include variables in the URL patterns, allowing you to create dynamic routes that can capture different values. This is useful when building applications that involve parameters or variable inputs, such as user profiles or product pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. URL Generation: Flask provides a feature called \"URL generation\" that allows you to generate URLs dynamically based on route names and arguments. This makes it easier to maintain links within your application, as changes to the URL patterns are automatically reflected throughout your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, app routes in Flask provide a way to map URLs to functions, enabling you to define the behavior of your web application or API. They help in organizing your code, handling requests, and creating dynamic and RESTful endpoints."

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",

    "In this example, we define three routes: `'/'`, `'/welcome'`, and `'/company'`. The `'/'` route generates URLs for the `'welcome'` and `'company_details'` endpoints using the `url_for()` function. These generated URLs are then used to create links on the home page (`'/'`) that lead to the respective endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the Flask application and visit `http://localhost:5000/`, you will see a list of URLs with links to the `'welcome'` and `'company_details'` pages. Clicking on these links will take you to the corresponding endpoints.\n",

    "The `url_for()` function is particularly useful when you have complex URL patterns or when you want to ensure that your application remains flexible even if the URLs change in the future.
