    "Q1. What is boosting in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions of several base estimators (weak learners) to improve overall performance. The idea is to train these base learners sequentially, each focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. The final model is a weighted sum of the individual models."
